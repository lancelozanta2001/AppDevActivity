	<p>Hi! My name is Lance Aron P. Lozanta, 22 years from Isok II, Boac, Marinduque. When I'm not engaged in my professional pursuits, I find solace and joy in a diverse array of hobbies. Whether it's the meditative strokes of a pencil on paper as I immerse myself in the world of drawing, the adrenaline-fueled adventures of virtual realms in video games where I can unleash my competitive spirit, or the invigorating sensation of wind against my face as I pedal through scenic landscapes on my bike, each activity offers a unique escape and source of fulfillment in my life.</p>

	<h3 class="background">Background on Information Technology:</h3>
	<p>During my formative years in senior high school, I made a pivotal decision to pursue the academic track within the strand of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Delving into this specialized curriculum, I found myself immersed in a rich tapestry of subjects, with a particular emphasis on mathematics and research. It was within the realm of research-focused subjects that I discovered a profound passion for uncovering new knowledge and delving into the intricacies of problem-solving. These experiences ignited a spark within me, igniting a path toward a future in information technology. Now, as I navigate the halls of higher education in pursuit of my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, I am continually inspired by the transformative power of technology and the boundless opportunities it presents for innovation and advancement. This journey from the foundations laid in senior high school to my current academic endeavors exemplifies the profound impact of early educational experiences in shaping my trajectory toward a fulfilling and rewarding career in IT.</p>
